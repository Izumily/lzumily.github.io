        Hi, nice to meet you, my name is Siyang Lu. </p>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m a student who is studying at <i>City College of San Francisco</i>. My major is <b>Visual Media Design</b>, so that is the reason which I decided to take this class. I love to create things. Whether it is articles, photography, post-production, or just some simple video editing, I always have enough patience to learn, and to make that knowledge into my brain. So far, I have mastered more versatile knowledge through this class. I guess it is the right time to see my works, please go back to the top and visits them. </p>
        
     <p> <b>Well then, See you there! :)</b></p>
