        <h2>Animation Final Project</h2>
        </article>
    <p>
        This is the most exciting thing for me, and it is the most difficult topic for me. Because of my poor painting skills, I used some of the techniques I learned elsewhere to enrich my Flash animation.<pr/></p>
    <p>Inspiration comes from a perfume advertisement that was seen many years ago. Based on the understanding of the movement curve and the number of frames, I tried to meet the requirements in the most concise way. But I have to admit that this is the hardest of all the Adobe software Iâ€™ve learned so far.</p>
